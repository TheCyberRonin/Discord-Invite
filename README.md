# Discord-Invite
This little project is meant to imitate Discord's invite into any web page with the minified JS and CSS. All you have to do is provide a tag with an ID to inject the invite and the invite code (the `code` part of https://discord.gg/code).

Take a look at [the example](https://github.com/TheCyberRonin/Discord-Invite/blob/master/lib/index.html) of how to use it.

It'll look something like this: ![example](test/example.PNG)
